# Understanding-and-Predicting-Property-Maintenance-Fine

I.	Assignment Overview:
The Michigan Data Science Team (MDST) and the Michigan Student Symposium for Interdisciplinary Statistical Sciences (MSSISS) have partnered with the City of Detroit to help solve one of the most pressing problems facing Detroit - blight. Blight Violationss are issued by the city to individuals who allow their properties to remain in a deteriorated condition. Every year, the city of Detroit issues millions of dollars in fines to residents and every year, many of these fines remain unpaid. Enforcing unpaid blight fines is a costly and tedious process, so the city wants to know: how can we increase blight ticket compliance?
For this assignment, create a function that trains a model to predict blight ticket compliance in Detroit using readonly/train.csv. Using this model, return a series of length 61001 with the data being the probability that each corresponding ticket from readonly/test.csv will be paid, and the index being the ticket_id.
